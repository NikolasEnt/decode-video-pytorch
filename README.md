# Video decoding for DL models training with PyTorch

The repo was developed as an illustration for London PyTorch Meetup talk
"Optimising Video Pipelines for Neural Network Training with PyTorch" on 21/11/2024
by _Nikolay Falaleev_.

It containes examples of different approaches to video frames decoding, which can be used
for training deep learning models with PyTorch.
